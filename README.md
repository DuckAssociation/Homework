# Homework for C# course

Will be adding new homework for each new session.

### I am lost! What to do?!
 1) Open solution (.sln) with Visual Studio (you need to get all homework folder);
 2) Find a file (.cs) to write your code;
 3) Follow instructions provided in commented (```/**/ ``` or ```//```) parts of the file (.cs);
 4) To test your implementation press ```ctrl+R``` and ```ctrl+A``` while holding ```ctrl``` all the time. Or in ```Visual Studio -> Test -> Run -> All Tests```;
 5) To review results you will need to open Test Explorer window by pressing ```ctrl+E``` and ```ctrl+T``` while holding ```ctrl``` all the time. Or in ```Visual Studio -> Test -> Windows -> Test Explorer```.
 
 ### Content

Each session will have dedicated folder with homework in it. You will want to clone or simply download repository and then implement assigned homework tasks.

### How do I know when I am done?
When you run the tests you want to see all tests pass (to be marked green).

### Rules
You want to create your own GitHub repository where you will be putting all of your completed homework assignments. This repository should have similar structure as this repository. Each session should have a dedicated folder with completed homework assignment.

Usually homework will be divided in three sections, each section is ranked by difficulty. From easier to harder. We do hope you will complete all of the assignments but that is not mandatory.

At random, person or group of people will be chosen to present their homework at the beginning of each session, so be prepared.
