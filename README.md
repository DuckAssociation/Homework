# Homework for c# course

Will be adding new homework for each new session.

### I am lost! What to do?!
 1) Open solution (.sln);
 2) Find a file (.cs) to write your code;
 3) Follow instructions provided in commented (```/**/ ``` or ```//```) parts of the file (.cs);
 4) To test your implementation press ```ctrl+R``` and ```ctrl+A``` while holding ```ctrl``` all the time. Or in ```Visual Studio -> Test -> Run -> All Tests```;
 5) To review results you will need to open Test Explorer window by pressing ```ctrl+E``` and ```ctrl+T``` while holding ```ctrl``` all the time. Or in ```Visual Studio -> Test -> Windows -> Test Explorer```.
 
 ### Content

Each session will have dedicated folder with homework in it. You will want to clone it or simply download it and use to implement assigned homework task.

### How do I know when I am done?
When you run the tests you want to see all tests pass (to be marked green).

### Rules
You want to create your own GitHub repository where you will be putting all of your completeled homework assignments. This repository should have similiar structure as this repository. Each session should have a dedicated folder with completed homework assignment.

Usually homeworks will be devided in three sections, each section is ranked by dificulty. From easier to harder. We do hope you will complete all of the assignements but that is not mandatory.
