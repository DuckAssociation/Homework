            // 2) Create two or more implementations (classes) for that interface.
            // 3) Create a class (A) that accept these interfaces as an array into constructor.
            // 4) Pass in two or more interfaces into class (A).
            // 5) Call a method of class (A) which calls all passed in interfaces methods.
                // I.E. Interface has method print(), when you call class (A) method print 
                // it will call print method on all interfaces passed in the costructor.
            
            // Second:
            // Do the same thing only using delegates (Func, Action);

            // Note: this time we have manual testing by you :)
