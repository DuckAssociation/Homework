Compare object with class.
Compare linked list with array.
Think of a data structure that is based on arrays but can hold arbitrary number of elements.


Extra material:
Now you know how to implement queue, set and dictionary.
What is the time cost of inserting element into queue? How many lines of code will be executed? Including repeated lines inside loops.

Those are not optimal algorithms, there are faster algorithms to make set.
  Sorting array using object (string) comparason.
  Impelemnt binary search in an array.
  Implement binary search set.
  Implement binary search dictionary.
  Reasoning about lines of code executed for linear search and binary search.

  Hashing using modulo arithmetic.
  Implementing HashArraySet
  Implementing HashArrayDictionary
  Reasoning about lines of code executed for ArraySet versus HashArraySet for operations like Insert or Contains.
